# MYSQL To Firebase Migration (Java/Maven)
This project is a simple project that migrates data from a MySQL database to a Firebase Realtime Database.
I just decided to use Java and Maven to because I can give reference to any one that wants to use Firebase Java SDK.

#### please note this not my cleansed code, I just wanted to get the job done. This project was success.
- Likely would use batch with firebase. For example.
